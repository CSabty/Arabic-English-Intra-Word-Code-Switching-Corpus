# Language Identification of Intra-Word Code-Switching for Arabic--English Corpus

We collected our Arabic-English Code Swithcing data and annotated the tokens with their corresponding language tag. To the best of our knowledge it is the first annotated AR-EN data-set for intra-word code-switching Language Identificationtask. As users use informal languages and frequently mix between them on social media. The total number of collected sentences is 2,507 consisting of 30,321 annotated tokens. Then, we analyzed the data to know the statistic of how the tags are distributed over the data. We implemented three techniques to collect our data and build the corpus. The first technique was gathering datafrom Twitter using Tweepy API1, and we collected 8,589 tokens. The second one was to collect data from Facebook, and we got 8,692 tokens. The third one was to collect WhatsApp data, and it was the most successful as we got 13,040 tokens.
